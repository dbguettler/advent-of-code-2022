cd day1 && node main debug
```

To run with full size input file:

```

## Files

The main code file for each day is provided in `main.js`, with the files `input-sm.txt` for the example small input file and `input-lg.txt` for the full size provided input. Any useful utility functions used across multiple days are included in `shared/utils.js`.
